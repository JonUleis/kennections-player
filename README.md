# Kennections Player

This web app allows the new Mental Floss "Kennections" trivia games to be played with an interactive interface that allows you to type in answers, reminiscent of the pre-March 2022 redesign.

Game data is loaded in from Mental Floss during each site visit, then parsed into questions and answers in-browser.
